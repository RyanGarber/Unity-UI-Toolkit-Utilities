# Unity UI Toolkit Utility
Utilities for UI Toolkit. None of these features are optimized at the moment. These are only provided as examples to build upon.

### Selectors
Instead of using Unity's convoluted, inconsistent, obtuse UQuery, use selectors you're familiar with.
- Types: `Find("Button")`
- Descendents: `Find("#list .list-entry")`
- Children: `Find("#list > .list-entry")`
- Wildcards: `Find("*")`
